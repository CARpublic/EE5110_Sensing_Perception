# EE5110 Sensing and Perception
This is a code repository for EE5110 Sensing and Perception for Robotics and Autonomy.

This is the first initial commit, bear with while I get everything up and running.

## Localization
This provides examples of Kalman filters and similar localization algorithms. Most of the examples are either taken or adapted from https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics.
This repo is a brilliant resource in general and I thoroughly recommend checking it out.

## Instructions
TBC, working on requirements file etc.
